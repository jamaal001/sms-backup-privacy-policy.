# Privacy Policy for SMS Backup

**Last Updated:** [Date] (e.g., October 26, 2023)

### 1. Introduction

SMS Backup ("the App") is an open-source Android application designed to backup your SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) messages to your device's local storage. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

### 2. Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be perfectly clear: **This application does not collect, transmit, or store any of your data on any server outside of your device.** All processing is done locally on your phone.

*   **We do not collect** your SMS or MMS messages.
*   **We do not collect** your contact information.
*   **We do not collect** your personal information.
*   **We do not transmit** any data from your device to the internet.
*   **We do not share** any data with any third parties.

### 3. Information Handling and Storage

The App requires permission to **READ_SMS** to access your message content and **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** to create backup files.

*   **Usage of Data:** The App uses the `READ_SMS` permission solely to read the content of your SMS/MMS messages from your device's internal database when you press the "Save your SMS Messages" button.
*   **Storage of Data:** The backup files (`incoming.txt` and `outgoing.txt`) are saved **only** to your device's public Downloads folder. You are in complete control of these files. The App does not and cannot access any other files on your device.
*   **Data Transmission:** There is no functionality in the App to send data over the internet. Your messages never leave your device.

### 4. Your Consent

By using the App, you consent to the local processing of your SMS and MMS messages as described in this policy.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
